## Who’s Trolling on the on the internet?

Do you like surfing the internet? What kind of social media do you use, Facebook, or Twitter? You must have come across a situation where you saw an interesting post and clicked on the comments section, only to scroll a few times and find someone complaining in the comments, or replying to someone else's comment with something unpleasant. Why do people like to "Troll" on the internet? What kind of people are you more likely to meet on the internet or in the comments section? Is it true that the longer you stay online, the more likely you are to become a "Troll"?

Like you, scholars are curious about the answer to this question. So, the scholars investigated the issue by distributing a questionnaire. And found that among a group of undergraduate college students in the United States, students became more anxious as they used their smartphones more frequently.(1) But as always, academics are critical, and another scholar found that this was not the case for some teenagers in Ireland, the UK and the US(2) . Why is this? One possibility is that people behave differently or choose different answers when they know they are participating in a study.

To solve this problem, we can directly collect how people behave on the internet. For example, using sentiment analysis to determine if your postings are full of negative emotions. Or we could use your online footprint (number of posts, social media rating) to determine if you are addicted to the internet. Based on this approach, and after a very long ethical evaluation, we have finally got the results.

In our study we found some interesting correlations among more than 2,000 social media users who had already posted negative content. As you might imagine, the majority of people who like to spread negative emotions or start arguments in the comments section are not very likely to choose to 'Troll' on their own homepage. Furthermore, depending on the gender of people who set up on their social media profiles, women do tend to be more active online and post more negatively than men (of course, this could also be because they post more often or have more followers).(3)

In fact, based on previous research(4),it has been found that using the Internet for social purposes can have a negative impact on mental health. This can be explained in our study by the fact that if people post or comment on social media for social purposes, then posting more negative content may indicate poor mental health or well-being.

Similarly, a related study found that too much time spent on the Internet may bring about negative emotions (5) . When people have more negative emotions, they will be more likely to let them out. This then induces more negative posts.

It is not hard to see that many studies made so far have only suggested correlations, but still lack systematic integration. The factors that influence people's 'Trolling' on the internet are likely to be complex. Understanding this behaviour also requires more theory and data to be analysed. This is where we aim to take the next step in our research.

So what can we do about internet trolls? We have selected some of Julia McCoy's(6) suggestions for people:

- [x]Don’t Feed the Trolls
   - Research has found(7) that trolls just want to get more attention or just to have fun, so by not engaging with them, they can be effectively suppressed.
- [x]Have Friends-Only Social Profiles
   - This solution is very simple, out of sight, out of mind.
- [x]Block, Ban, or Report Trolls
   - Everyone has a responsibility to respect and create a peaceful and friendly space on the internet.
- [x]Decompress Before You Reply
   - This is similar to the first one, but when you have to reply, remember that Trolls just want to have fun, and you are falling into their trap when you start to get angry.
