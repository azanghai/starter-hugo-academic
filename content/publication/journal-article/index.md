abstract: "Watching online videos (including short-form videos) has become the
  most popular leisure activity in China. However, a few studies have reported
  the potential negative effects of online video watching behaviors (including
  the potential for ‘addiction’) among a minority of individuals. The present
  study investigated online video watching behaviors, motivational factors for
  watching online videos, and potentially addictive indicators of watching
  online videos. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 20 young
  Chinese adults. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Eight
  themes were identified comprising: (i) content is key; (ii) types of online
  video watching; (iii) platform function hooks; (iv) personal interests; (v)
  watching becoming habitual; (vi) social interaction needs; (vii) reassurance
  needs; and (viii) addiction-like symptoms. Specific video content (e.g.,
  mukbang, pornography), platform-driven continuous watching, and short-form
  videos were perceived by some participants as being potentially addictive.
  Specific features or content on Chinese online video platforms (e.g., ‘Danmu’
  scrolling comments) need further investigation. Future studies should explore
  users’ addictive-like behaviors in relation to specific types of online video
  content and their social interaction on these platforms."
